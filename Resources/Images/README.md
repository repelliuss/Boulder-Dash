# Each *X*th level folder needs these:
* icon.png
* miscellaneous.png
* start_screen.png

*You need to put those to make it playable!*

## What are those?

* icon.png is 64x64 png file. Its image will be displayed on OS taskbar.
* miscellaneous.png is just miscellaneous but there should be an image of
  character. I blurred it due to legal reasons but you can modify it.
* start_screen.png is the image that is showed after the game launch. 1920x1080 preferred.
